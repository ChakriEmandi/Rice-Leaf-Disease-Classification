# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Classification
This project focuses on classifying rice leaf diseases using deep 
learning. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on
 MobileNet to identify 8 distinct types of rice leaf diseases 
efficiently.
## Features
Model Architecture: MobileNet, a lightweight and efficient CNN model optimized for mobile and edge devices.
Dataset: Includes diverse samples of rice leaf images categorized into 8 disease classes.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained with state-of-the-art techniques for accurate and reliable classification.
Deployment Ready: Designed for real-time application in agricultural monitoring and disease management.
